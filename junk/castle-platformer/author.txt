Desc:
Assets for a castlevania-like platformer I mocked up quite some time ago.
Stiff and kinda crappy animation on the main character.
Includes tiles, two parallax backgrounds, a main character, and a really badly-done bat.
Colors on the exterior environment could use some love, but that was one of a whole bunch of things I didn't have the time to address.
Two screenshots showing what you can do with it.
