Also included the toolset:

* Level editor

* Animation viewer

## Requirements

The only required library to run the engine is [SFML 2.0](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

Works in both 32-bits and 64-bits OS.

Tested on Ubuntu Xenial 64-bits and Precise 32-bits.

# WARNING

## The engine is still under development, so the source code is a mess
